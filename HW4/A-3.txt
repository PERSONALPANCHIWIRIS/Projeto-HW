The three more discriminitive clusters were 1, 2 and 5. For both 2 and 5, because their purity
is relatively low we can not safely conclude that the values represented in their centroids
(Pregnancy, glucose, Blodd pressure, etc) are safe indicators for their respective majority class
(0 and 1, respectively). Only thing we can conclude is that there is a majority of a single class 
in each one. 
For cluster 1, however, with a purity of 0.9071, we can use as a classifier the values represented
in its centroid as typical characteristics of a patient without diabetes, which means that most 
patients in this cluster are safe from diabetes.
