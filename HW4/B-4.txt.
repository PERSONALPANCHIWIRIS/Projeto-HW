LDA. PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving variance. Useful for compression and visualization, 
but it does not optimize separation between classes. LDA is designed to discriminate classes
(supervised) and is often more suitable. Based on the histograms of PC1 vs LDA, LDA offers better class
separation and less overlap. Therefore, for building a discriminator, LDA is the most appropriate choice.
