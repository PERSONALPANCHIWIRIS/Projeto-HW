This method uses unsupervised clusters in classifiers. Each cluster is assigned its majority class.
This method depends for its effectiveness on the fact of matching clusters and true classes. 
There may, however, be cases where a majority class is assigned to a cluster by a marginal 
difference between the two original classes present, which leads to a limited classification. The resulting 
accuracy (0.7018) is not so bad, yet the accuracy value would be higher case a supervised 
clustering model were used. For data that has no clear separations and natural groupings 
(as in medical datasets) K-means is not a valid classifier. It would be better to opt for a decision tree 
classifier
